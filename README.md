# Outlaws_Garage
Outlaws Garage (https://www.outlawsgaragemi.com) is a mobile mechanic business. The static website contains information about the company, it's staff, and information about how to schedule auto repair service. 

Design of the website is all original and is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Colors and fonts were chosen to make the website stand-out while also being easy to read and focus on. 

#Developement
Project development started after getting client standards and expectations. The client had little in the way of image assets or content, so much of this had to be created. The website was produced within a deadline,, then reviewed by the client to ensure satisfaction before publishing. 

After publishing, the client was able to start referring customers to the website for information about their services. The website also allowed the company to be disconverable via search engines.

#Roadmap
Future ideas for the project that were proposed to the client include an online scheduling system and the ability to make payments online. An email contact form built with a Node.JS backend is also being considered.
